# Major Project Phase 1 - Analysing Impact of Music on Human Emotions Using EEG Signals

This repository contains the implementation of an **EEG (Electroencephalogram)-based emotion recognition system** built using Python. The project performs data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine-learning/deep-learning based classification to detect emotional states from EEG signals.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is an EEG-based system designed to objectively analyse and classify music induced emotions using artificial intelligence. It employs a CNN–BiLSTM deep learning model to 
process signals across various age groups, genders, and musical genres
