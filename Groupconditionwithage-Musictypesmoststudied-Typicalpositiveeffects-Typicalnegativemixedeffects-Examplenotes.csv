Group / condition (with age),Music types most studied,Typical positive effects,Typical negative / mixed effects,Example notes
Infants & young children (0–5 years),"Lullabies, simple melodic songs, caregiver‑sung music","Calmer heart rate and better sleep; support for language, attention, and early motor coordination.","Overstimulating, loud, or very fast music can increase arousal and restlessness.","In neonatal and pediatric care, structured music therapy can support development and reduce distress in at‑risk children."
School‑age children (6–12 years),"Play songs, pop, instrumental background music","Moderate, pleasant music can improve on‑task behavior, motivation, and some memory tasks.",Very loud or highly lyrical music can distract from demanding schoolwork and reduce performance.,Effects often work through arousal and mood: music that is not too calm or too intense tends to help learning.
Adolescents (13–17 years),"Pop, rock, hip‑hop, self‑selected playlists","Self‑chosen music often reduces stress, improves mood, and supports identity and social connection.",Very aggressive or extremely sad music may maintain negative mood or rumination in some teens.,Systematic reviews show music‑based programs can improve emotional regulation and overall mental health in adolescents.
Young adults (18–35 years),Wide range; self‑selected vs researcher‑selected music,"Relaxing or liked music can reduce perceived stress, anxiety, and improve mood during tasks; may aid simple cognitive performance.","Not all studies find strong effects; in some experiments, music selection and gender showed little direct impact on stress or mood overall.","Many lab studies use young adults for tests of working memory, attention, and emotion under different music conditions."
Middle‑aged adults (36–59 years),"Popular music from youth, classical, background music","Similar to young adults: preferred music helps mood regulation, stress reduction, and can support task engagement.","Very loud or distracting music may impair performance on complex tasks, especially under high workload.","Some lifespan studies combine this group with “adults,” but note that preferences often shift toward familiar and less intense music."
Older adults (60+ years),"Familiar oldies, classical, happy‑sounding music","Happy‑sounding or preferred music can elevate mood, optimize arousal, and support some cognitive tasks (e.g., processing speed, memory cues).",Very complex or unfamiliar music can be less engaging or fatiguing for some; effects vary with hearing and cognitive status.,Older adults may experience stronger mood benefits from preferred music compared with younger adults after negative mood inductions.
"Women (general, 18+ years)","Relaxing, pleasant, and aversive music compared",Often show stronger emotional self‑reports and physiological responses to emotional or aversive music; relaxing music can reduce stress and anxiety.,"Some studies report “hypersensitivity” to unpleasant or dissonant music, with larger stress‑related physiological reactions.","Stress‑reduction studies show music improves emotional health in both genders, but intensity and pattern of response may differ in women."
"Men (general, 18+ years)","Relaxing, pleasant, and aversive music compared",Relaxing or self‑selected music reduces stress and improves mood; some work suggests men may benefit more from self‑chosen tracks than assigned music.,"May report lower emotional intensity to the same music compared with women, though findings are mixed.","Reviews note that overall mood and stress benefits of music occur in both men and women, while gender differences are usually moderate."
"Short‑term stress / anxiety (all ages, typically 13+ years in studies)","Relaxing, slow‑tempo, instrumental, nature‑inspired music","Lower self‑reported stress and anxiety, reduced heart rate and blood pressure, and improved perceived relaxation across many lab and clinical settings.","In high‑demand tasks, music with lyrics or very high tempo can interfere with concentration even if it feels pleasant.",Studies in students and workers show music as a low‑cost strategy for acute stress relief and mood regulation.
Chronic pain & physical conditions (mostly adults),"Calm music, patient‑preferred music, structured music therapy","Reductions in perceived pain, anxiety, and sometimes medication use; better coping and quality of life.","Effects are usually moderate, not a replacement for medical treatment; not every patient responds strongly.","Music is often added as an adjunct in pain clinics, rehabilitation, and palliative care for supportive benefit."
"Long‑term neurological issues (e.g., stroke, acquired brain injury; children and adults)","Rhythmic auditory stimulation, task‑oriented music therapy","Support for motor recovery (gait training), speech and language rehabilitation, and attention training.","Requires trained therapists and structured programs; not all domains (e.g., complex reasoning) improve equally.",Integrating music therapy with physiotherapy or speech therapy can enhance rehabilitation outcomes in children and adults.
Dementia / Alzheimer’s disease (usually 65+ years),"Familiar songs, individualized playlists, group singing","Reduced agitation, improved mood and social interaction, temporary improvement in orientation and autobiographical recall.",Effects are usually short‑term and depend on matching music to the person’s history and preferences.,Personalized playlists and group singing programs are widely used in dementia care homes to enhance quality of life.
Depression and anxiety disorders (adolescents to older adults),"Preferred relaxing music, active music therapy, songwriting",Decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms when music therapy is added to standard care; better emotional expression and coping.,Very sad or repetitive rumination‑related listening habits can maintain low mood in some individuals.,Systematic reviews show music‑based interventions have small‑to‑moderate positive effects on mood disorders.
